There is no reason for I me to say that I am ill because no one would believe me . My life is worthless because I am all alone with no one to stay with me . A young man has left me . It has now been a year and six months since he abandoned me . I have faith that God has accepted him . I have faith that he is in the “ happy place , " that he has found his brother . I have faith that he has found his parent . When I think about it , he would have suffered if I had left him first . Then I feel a little better . Ꭿ
